# dfgQtTableEditor

Example application for viewing and editing csv-files demonstrating features in dfglib.

## Building

### Version 0.9.9.x:
Requires basic C++11 support (as available since VC2010), Qt 5 and Boost (in include path).

To build (assuming having compatible Qt version, Qt Creator and compiler available):
* Open dfgQtTableEditor.pro in Qt Creator
* Choose suitable Qt kit to use
* Click build

Has been build with the following setups:

* MSVC 2010, Qt 5.2.1, Boost 1.70, 32-bit (Windows 8.1)
* MSVC 2012, Qt 5.2.1, Boost 1.70, 64-bit (Windows 8.1)
* MSVC 2013, Qt 5.4.2, Boost 1.70, 64-bit (Windows 8.1)
* MSVC 2015 update 3, Qt 5.8, Boost 1.70, 64-bit (Windows 8.1)
* MSVC 2017.9, Qt 5.9.8, Boost 1.70, 64-bit (Windows 8.1)
* MSVC 2017.9, Qt 5.11.2, Boost 1.70, 64-bit (Windows 8.1)
* MSVC 2017.9, Qt 5.12, Boost 1.70, 64-bit (Windows 8.1)
* MSVC 2017.9, Qt 5.13, Boost 1.70, 64-bit (Windows 8.1)
* GCC 5.4.0, Qt 5.5.1, Boost 1.61, 32-bit (Ubuntu 16.04.6, 32-bit)
* GCC 7.4.0, Qt 5.9.5, Boost 1.65.1, 64-bit (Ubuntu 18.04.2, 64-bit)
* Clang 3.8.0, Qt 5.5.1, Boost 1.61, 32-bit (Ubuntu 16.04.6, 32-bit)
* Clang 6.0.0, Qt 5.9.5, Boost 1.65.1, 64-bit (Ubuntu 18.04.2, 64-bit)

Note that in Qt versions 5.10-5.12.3, keyboard shortcuts won't show as intended in context menu (for further details, see [QTBUG-61181](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-61181), [QTBUG-71471](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-71471)).

## Features

* Separator auto-detection: instead of e.g. relying on list separator defined in OS settings (like done by some spreadsheet applications), uses heuristics to determine separator character. Auto-detection supports comma (,), semicolon (;), tab (\t) and unit separator (\x1F).
* Text-oriented: content is shown as read, no data type interpretations are made.
* Easy to use basic filtering: Alt+F -> type filter string -> view shows only rows whose content (on any column) match with filter string. Matching syntax supports for example wildcard and regular expression.
* Diffing using 3rd party diff tool (manual configuration).
* Support for per-file configurations that can be used for example to define format characters and column widths in UI.
* When saving to file, tries to use the same format as what was used when reading the file (e.g. use the same separator character)
* Somewhat reasonable performance: opening a 140 MB, 1000000 x 20 test csv-file with content "abcdef" in every cell, lasted less than 4 seconds with dfgQtTableEditor default read options (and less than 2 seconds with manually given read options, most importantly disabled quote parsing), in LibreOffice 6.1.6.3 on the same Windows desktop machine read took over 30 seconds.
* No artificial row/column count restrictions. Note, though, that data structures and implementation in general are not designed for huge files. Underlying data structure is optimized for in-order walk through column content.
* Supported encodings:
    * Read: UTF-8, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE, Latin-1, Windows-1252
        * Note: when file has no BOM, reading assumes Latin-1
    * Write: UTF-8, Latin-1
* Undo & redo and detailed undo control.
* Auto-completion (column-specific)

## Tips

* For optimal read speed
    * Input should be in UTF-8 encoding and application should know this e.g. through file having BOM or through UI.
    * File should have no enclosing characters (i.e. quoting) and read options should have enclosing character as none and completer columns should be empty.

## Configuration options

### Application configuration

Stored in ini-file with path \<executable path\>.ini
Example file with comments describing the setting.
<pre>
[dfglib]

; -----------------------------------------------------------
; General settings

; Windows-specific: if set, application tries to create crash dump in case of crash.
; Default: false
enableAutoDumps=1

; Path of executable to use when diffing.
; Default: empty
diffProgPath=C:/Program Files/TortoiseSVN/bin/TortoiseMerge.exe

; -----------------------------------------------------------
; TableEditor

; Defines height of single cell editor widget.
; If value is plain integer, defines absolute height.
; If starts with %, defines height in percents of parent windows height.
; Default: 50

; Defines font size in cell editor widget
TableEditor_cellEditorFontPointSize=13

; -----------------------------------------------------------
; CsvItemModel

; Column for which to use auto-completion feature.
; To enable for all columns, use *
; To enable for selected columns, provide comma-separator list of column indexes
; To disable, leave value empty
; Note: In many cases it probably makes more sense to define this as file-specific property.
; Default: empty (=completer is disabled)
CsvItemModel_completerEnabledColumnIndexes=*

; Size limit for enabling completer: files larger than this value will be loaded with disabled completer even if completer is enabled by CsvItemModel_completerEnabledColumnIndexes

CsvItemModel_completerEnabledSizeLimit=10000000

; Advanced write performance tuning: defines the maximum file below which files are written to memory before writing to file.
; Omit setting or use value -1 to let application decide.
CsvItemModel_maxFileSizeForMemoryStreamWrite=100000000

### csv-file -specific configuration

File-specific configuration can be used for example to
* Read the file correctly (e.g. in case of less common format)
* Optimize the read speed by disabling unneeded parsing features
* Set UI column widths so that content shows in preferred way.

Configuration is defined through a .conf file in path \<csv-file path\>.conf. File can be generated from table view context menu from "Config" -> "Save config file...". The .conf file is a key-value map encoded into a csv-file:

* Supports URI-like lookup, where depth is implemented by increasing column index for key-item.
* Key is the combination of first item in a row and if not on the first column, prepended by most recent key in preceding column.

Available keys:
| Key (URI)      | Purpose  | Possible values | Notes |
| -------------  | -----    | ------          | ----- |
| columnsByIndex/ColumnIndexHere/width_pixels | Defines column width in pixels for given column | integer | |
| encoding | When set, file is read assuming it to be of given encoding. | Latin1, UTF8, UTF16BE, UTF16LE, UTF32BE, UTF32LE, windows-1252 | This setting is used even if file has a BOM that indicates different encoding |
| enclosing_char | File is read interpreting the given character as enclosing character | ASCII-character as such or escaped format, e.g. \t or \x1f | |
| separator_char | File is read interpreting the given character as separator character | Like for enclosing_char | |
| end_of_line_type | File is read using end-of-line type | \n, \r\n, \r | |
| bom_writing | Whether to write BOM on save | 0, 1 | |
| properties/completerColumns | see CsvItemModel_completerEnabledColumnIndexes | | |
| properties/completerEnabledSizeLimit | see CsvItemModel_completerEnabledSizeLimit | | |
