RFC 4180 section,Property,dfgQtTableEditor,[RFC 4180](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180),RFC 4180 compliance,Notes
2.1,Line break,"LF (default), CRLF, CR. Editor tries to use the same line break when writing that was present in read file.",CRLF,Deviates: allows other line breaks than just CRLF,
2.2,Last record line break,"Either style accepted on read, on write line break is written",May or may not have an ending line break,:white_check_mark:,
2.3,Header,"On read, first line is always treated as header, but can be manually moved to first row after load. On write, header is written by default, option to disable writing is in advanced save options.","Header is optional, but it ""should contain the same number of fields as the records in the rest of the file""","Deviates: when reading, header is not required to have the same number of columns as records (number of columns in table is simply taken from maximum column count from all records), but written files have the same number of headers on all records.",
2.4.1,Multiple fields separated by commas,"Several field separators are supported by default (comma (,), semi-colon (;), tab (\t) and unit separator (\x1f)). Additionally other single-char separators can be used with advanced read and write options.","""Within the header and each record, there may be one or more fields, separated by commas""","Deviates: allows other separators in addition to comma (,)",
2.4.2,Equal field number,"Equal field count is not required in records, a record with less fields than some other record is interpreted as having empty fields at the the end. When writing, all records will have the same number of fields even if input file had differing counts.","""Each line should contain the same number of fields throughout the file""","Deviates: similar to section 2.3: not required on read, but column counts will be identical in written files.",
2.4.3,Spaces in field,"Spaces are preserved. With enclosed cells, enclosing char must appear as the first char in field, otherwise field enclosing chars are not interpreted as such. Also any trailing chars after enclosed field are ignored.","""Spaces are considered part of a field and should not be ignored""",:white_check_mark:,"Reader back end (DelimitedTextReader) has option to ignore leading whitespaces ('rfSkipLeadingWhitespaces'), but not used in dfgQtTableEditor"
2.4.4,Trailing comma,Last field is not followed by separator,"""The last field in the record must not be followed by a comma""",:white_check_mark:,
2.5.1,Enclosing with double quotes,"Enclosed fields supported on both read and write; when writing, fields are by default enclosed only if needed. Default enclosing char is double quote (0x22), but can be customised.","""Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes""",Deviates: supports also different enclosing characters,
2.5.2,Double quotes without enclosed field,"If enclosing chars appear in field but field doesn't begin with such, enclosing chars are treated as regular field content.","""If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then double quotes may not appear inside the fields""","Deviates: can read fields that are not enclosed, but still contain enclosing character. Written files are compliant.",
2.6,Requirements when field needs to be enclosed,"Supported in generalized sense: fields are enclosed when needed, i.e. if they contain line break, enclosing char or separator char.","""Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas should be enclosed in double-quotes""",:white_check_mark:,
2.7,Escaping enclosing char,Enclosing chars within fields are escaped by doubling the char,"""Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas should be enclosed in double-quotes""",:white_check_mark:,
3,MIME type registration,Not used,Describes requirements for MIME handling,N/A,
N/A,Encoding,"Read: UTF-8 (default), UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE, Latin-1, Windows-1252. Write: UTF-8 (default), Latin-1",N/A (encoding requirements not mentioned),N/A,
N/A,Pre-header lines,"Not supported (as of 2.7.0). For read-only purpose, read filter may be used to filter out the pre-header lines",N/A (not mentioned),N/A,Some dsv-like files may have content before actual header row
N/A,Comment lines,"Not supported (as of 2.7.0). For read-only purpose, read filter may be used to filter out lines that e.g. start with certain letter.",N/A (not mentioned),N/A,
N/A,Delimiter merging,Not supported (as of 2.7.0),N/A (not mentioned),N/A,For example LibreOffice offers such functionality when opening csv-file.
